# Roomkey Back End Development Challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining the team here at Roomkey. Part of our evaluation process for potential team members is to have them submit sample code.  Please provided an annotated Clojure solution to one or more of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) challenges.  Please submit your solution(s) via email with a link to a fork of this Github repo.

If you are new to Clojure, we don't expect concise, idiomatic code.  Instead, we want to see the decisions you have made and the rationale behind them (via annotations).  If you are an experienced Clojure developer, show us.

You are free to choose any PE challenge (or challenges) that you feel allows you to show off your knowledge of Clojure. [Number 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) is popular, and we can also recommend [number 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4).
